## About the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short 5-minute breaks. After four work sessions, a longer break is taken (typically 15-30 minutes).
